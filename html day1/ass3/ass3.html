<p>My Dog</p>
<pre>
<img src="dog.png" align="top"/>My dog Sasha is my best friend she likes to chase
the saccer ball when I practice. It is funny to
see her running down the field trying to catch the 
ball with her mouth.It just won't fit!</pre>

<pre>Once sasha saved my life When I was only 4 years old.Istarted to go into the street to get a ball that
had rolled across the street. oF course I did not think to look for cars! Sasha got in front of me and 
knocked me backwards onto the sidewalk. I was mod until I saw the car go by where  would have been.
Then I was so happy that Sasha was smarter than I was!</pre>
